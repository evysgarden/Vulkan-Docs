== Partitioned Top Level Acceleration Structures

Partitioned Top Level Acceleration Structures (PTLAS) allow efficient reuse
of previously constructed sections of the top level acceleration structure
by eliminating a full rebuild when only a few instances are modified.
This reduces build times and supports handling a higher number of instances,
making it more suitable for large and complex scenes.

PTLAS organizes instances into partitions, enabling a two-stage build
process: first, it constructs an acceleration structure for each partition
by grouping the instances within it, and second, it combines these partition
structures into a single acceleration structure, similar to the current
top-level acceleration structure.

To maintain compatibility, PTLAS behaves identically to the current
top-level acceleration structure from the perspective of ray tracing shaders
and pipelines.

[[ptlas-global-partition]]
PTLAS includes a unique global partition that operates independently of
other partitions.
Instances can: be assigned to this global partition just like they would to
regular partitions.
The global partition is well-suited for frequently updated instances, such
as animated characters.
During the build process, instances in the global partition are treated as
if they belong to individual partitions, without increasing the maximum
partition count.
However, instances in the global partition may still impact build
performance.
Once these instances become stable, they should be moved to a spatially
optimized, non-global partition to lower build costs and minimize trace
performance issues.

[[ptlas-partition-translation]]
To handle large worlds requiring more precision than 32-bit floating-point
numbers offer, PTLAS offers efficient partition translation.
Typically, applications maintain precision by placing the world center near
the camera.
Partition translation allows an additional translation of instances during
construction without changing their stored transforms.
This method stores instance transforms relative to partitions, applying a
translation to achieve accurate world positions.
Higher precision is maintained using smaller floating-point numbers until
the structure is built.
World space coordinates can: also be updated efficiently without rebuilding
the entire PTLAS.
Partition translation requires extra memory for untranslated instance
transforms and must: be explicitly enabled with
slink:VkPartitionedAccelerationStructureFlagsNV::pname:enablePartitionTranslation
flag.
