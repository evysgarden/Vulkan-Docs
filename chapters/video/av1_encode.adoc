== AV1 Encode Operations

Video encode operations using an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode profile>>
can: be used to encode elementary video stream sequences compliant with the
<<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the <<preamble, Preamble>> for information on how the Khronos
Intellectual Property Rights Policy relates to normative references to
external materials not created by Khronos.
====

This process is performed according to the <<encode-operation-steps,video
encode operation steps>> with the codec-specific semantics defined in
section 7 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>:

  * Syntax elements, derived values, and other parameters are applied from
    the following structures:
  ** The code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader structure, the optional
     code:StdVideoEncodeAV1DecoderModelInfo structure, and the optional
     array of code:StdVideoEncodeAV1OperatingPointInfo structures stored in
     the bound video session parameters object specifying the
     <<encode-av1-active-sequence-header,active sequence header>>.
  ** The code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo structure specifying the
     <<encode-av1-picture-info,AV1 picture information>>.
  ** The code:StdVideoEncodeAV1ReferenceInfo structures specifying the
     <<encode-av1-reference-info,AV1 reference information>> corresponding
     to the optional <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> and any
     <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>>.
  ** The encoded bitstream data is written to the destination video
     bitstream buffer range as defined in the
     <<encode-av1-bitstream-data-access,AV1 Encode Bitstream Data Access>>
     section.
  ** Picture data in the <<video-picture-resources,video picture resources>>
     corresponding to the used <<encode-input-picture,encode input
     picture>>, <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>>, and
     optional <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> is accessed as
     defined in the <<encode-av1-picture-data-access,AV1 Encode Picture Data
     Access>> section.
  * The decision on <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>> is made
    according to the parameters specified in the
    <<encode-av1-ref-pic-setup,AV1 picture information>>.

If the parameters adhere to the syntactic and semantic requirements defined
in the corresponding sections of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>, as
described above, and the <<dpb-slot,DPB slots>> associated with the
<<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>> all refer to
<<dpb-slot-states,valid picture references>>, then the video encode
operation will complete successfully.
Otherwise, the video encode operation may: complete
<<encode-unsuccessful,unsuccessfully>>.


[[encode-av1-overrides]]
=== AV1 Encode Parameter Overrides

Implementations may: override, unless otherwise specified, any of the AV1
encode parameters specified in the following Video Std structures:

  * code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader
  * code:StdVideoEncodeAV1DecoderModelInfo
  * code:StdVideoEncodeAV1OperatingPointInfo
  * code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo
  * code:StdVideoEncodeAV1ReferenceInfo

All such AV1 encode parameter overrides must: fulfill the conditions defined
in the <<encode-overrides,Video Encode Parameter Overrides>> section.

In addition, implementations must: not override any of the following AV1
encode parameters:

  * the following parameters specified in code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader:
  ** code:flags.still_picture
  ** code:flags.enable_order_hint
  ** code:flags.frame_id_numbers_present_flag
  ** code:flags.film_grain_params_present
  ** code:flags.timing_info_present_flag
  ** code:flags.initial_display_delay_present_flag
  ** code:delta_frame_id_length_minus_2
  ** code:additional_frame_id_length_minus_1
  ** code:order_hint_bits_minus_1
  * the following parameters specified in the code:StdVideoAV1ColorConfig
    structure pointed to by
    code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader::code:pColorConfig:
  ** code:flags.mono_chrome
  ** code:flags.color_range
  ** code:BitDepth
  ** code:subsampling_x
  ** code:subsampling_y
  ** code:color_primaries
  ** code:transfer_characteristics
  ** code:matrix_coefficients
  ** code:chroma_sample_position
  * the following parameters specified in the code:StdVideoAV1TimingInfo
    structure pointed to by
    code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader::code:pTimingInfo:
  ** code:flags.equal_picture_interval
  ** code:num_units_in_display_tick
  ** code:time_scale
  ** code:num_ticks_per_picture_minus_1
  * the parameters specified in code:StdVideoEncodeAV1DecoderModelInfo
  * the parameters specified in code:StdVideoEncodeAV1OperatingPointInfo
  * the following parameters specified in code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo:
  ** code:flags.show_frame
  ** code:flags.showable_frame
  ** code:frame_type
  ** code:frame_presentation_time
  ** code:current_frame_id
  ** code:order_hint
  ** code:refresh_frame_flags
  ** code:render_width_minus_1
  ** code:render_height_minus_1
  ** code:ref_order_hint
  ** code:ref_frame_idx
  ** code:delta_frame_id_minus_1
  * the following parameters specified in the
    code:StdVideoEncodeAV1ExtensionHeader structure pointed to by
    code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo::code:pExtensionHeader when
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:generateObuExtensionHeader
    is set to ename:VK_TRUE:
  ** code:temporal_id
  ** code:spatial_id

If slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:primaryReferenceCdfOnly is
set to ename:VK_TRUE for a video encode operation, the implementation will
not override code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo::code:primary_ref_frame.

[NOTE]
====
Implementations supporting the
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_STD_PRIMARY_REF_FRAME_BIT_KHR AV1 syntax element
capability reported in
slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:stdSyntaxFlags also guarantee
the use of the application-specified value for
code:StdVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfo::code:primary_ref_frame.
While support for ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_STD_PRIMARY_REF_FRAME_BIT_KHR
guarantees that the implementation will not override the
application-specified code:primary_ref_frame, it does not mandate the
implementation to use the reference picture indicated by
code:primary_ref_frame for sample prediction as implementations can always
decide to use only a subset of the application-specified reference pictures
for sample prediction.
This means that implementations supporting
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_STD_PRIMARY_REF_FRAME_BIT_KHR may end up using the
reference picture indicated by code:primary_ref_frame only for CDF data
reference even if the application did not set
slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:primaryReferenceCdfOnly to
ename:VK_TRUE.
====

[[encode-av1-resolution-override]]
If slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:codedPictureAlignment is not
equal to `{8,8}` for the used video profile, implementations will override
the coded picture's resolution and parameters related to the width and
height in the following manner:

  * Let [eq]#pname:w# and [eq]#pname:h# be the pname:codedExtent.width and
    pname:codedExtent.height of the slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR
    structure corresponding to the encode input picture, rounded up to the
    nearest integer multiple of 8.
  * Let [eq]#pname:aW# and [eq]#pname:aH# be [eq]#pname:w# and [eq]#pname:h#
    rounded up to the nearest integer multiple of
    pname:codedPictureAlignment.width and pname:codedPictureAlignment.height
    respectively.
  * If [eq]#pname:w# equals [eq]#pname:aW#, no override will occur.
    Otherwise the coded width will be [eq]#pname:aW#.
  * If [eq]#pname:h# equals [eq]#pname:aH#, no override will occur.
    Otherwise the coded height will be [eq]#pname:aH#.

[NOTE]
====
The AV1 specification codes all resolutions to an 8x8 alignment, but
supports unaligned resolutions through implicit cropping.
Thus, if the original coded extent, aligned to 8x8, meets the implementation
required alignment, no override needs to occur.
Otherwise, the implementation cannot code the requested coded extent, so the
final resolution in the bitstream is overridden to be aligned to the
implementation required alignment.

For example, consider an implementation that is only able to output
bitstreams that are 16x16 aligned (as indicated by
slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:codedPictureAlignment).
If an application requests the coded extent to be 1920x1080, the resulting
bitstream will be 1920x1088.
On the other hand, a request of 1920x1082 will result in no override, since
the 8x8 alignment of this resolution (1920x1088) is 16x16 aligned.
====

ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
In case of a <<encode-av1-parameter-sets,video session parameters>> object
created with
ename:VK_VIDEO_SESSION_PARAMETERS_CREATE_QUANTIZATION_MAP_COMPATIBLE_BIT_KHR,
the following <<encode-av1-sequence-header,AV1 sequence header>> parameters
may: be overridden by the implementation according to the
<<encode-quantization-map-texel-size,quantization map texel size>> the video
session parameters object was created with:

  * code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader::code:flags.use_128x128_superblock

This may: be necessary to change the AV1 superblock size used during
encoding to be compatible with the used quantization map texel size.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]

In case of AV1 encode parameters stored in <<encode-av1-parameter-sets,video
session parameters>> objects, applications need to use the
flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR command to determine whether any
implementation overrides happened.
If the query indicates that implementation overrides were applied, then the
application needs to retrieve and use the encoded AV1 sequence header in the
bitstream in order to be able to produce a compliant AV1 video bitstream
using the AV1 encode parameters stored in the video session parameters
object.

In case of any AV1 encode parameters stored in the encoded bitstream
produced by video encode operations, if the implementation supports the
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_HAS_OVERRIDES_BIT_KHR
<<queries-video-encode-feedback,video encode feedback query>> flag, the
application can: use such queries to retrieve feedback about whether any
implementation overrides have been applied to those AV1 encode parameters.


[[encode-av1-bitstream-data-access]]
=== AV1 Encode Bitstream Data Access

Each video encode operation writes either:

  * A single OBU with code:obu_type equal to code:OBU_FRAME comprising of
    the frame header and tile data of the encoded picture, or
  * An OBU with code:obu_type equal to code:OBU_FRAME_HEADER encapsulating
    the frame header of the encoded picture, followed by one or more OBUs
    with code:obu_type equal to code:OBU_TILE_GROUP comprising of the tile
    data of the encoded picture.

In addition, if
slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:generateObuExtensionHeader is
set to ename:VK_TRUE for the video encode operation, then OBU extension
headers are included in the generated bitstream as defined in sections
5.3.1, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.


[[encode-av1-picture-data-access]]
=== AV1 Encode Picture Data Access

Accesses to image data within a video picture resource happen at the
granularity indicated by
slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR::pname:pictureAccessGranularity, as returned by
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR for the used <<video-profiles,
video profile>>.
Accordingly, the complete image subregion of a <<encode-input-picture,encode
input picture>>, <<reference-picture,reference picture>>, or
<<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> accessed by video coding
operations using an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode profile>> is defined as
the set of texels within the coordinate range:

  {empty}:: [eq]#([0,pname:endX),[0,pname:endY))#

Where:

  * [eq]#pname:endX# equals [eq]#pname:codedExtent.width# rounded up to the
    nearest integer multiple of pname:pictureAccessGranularity.width and
    clamped to the width of the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the corresponding
    slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure;
  * [eq]#endY# equals [eq]#pname:codedExtent.height# rounded up to the
    nearest integer multiple of pname:pictureAccessGranularity.height and
    clamped to the height of the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the corresponding
    slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure;

Where pname:codedExtent is the member of the
slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure corresponding to the picture.

In case of video encode operations using an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode
profile>>, any access to a picture at the coordinates
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)#, as defined by the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
Specification>>, is an access to the image subresource
<<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the corresponding
slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure at the texel coordinates
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)#.

Implementations may: choose not to access some or all texels within
particular <<reference-picture,reference pictures>> available to a video
encode operation (e.g. due to <<encode-overrides,video encode parameter
overrides>> restricting the effective set of used reference pictures, or if
the encoding algorithm chooses not to use certain subregions of the
reference picture data for sample prediction).


[[encode-av1-reference-names]]
=== AV1 Reference Names and Semantics

Individual reference frames used in the encoding process have different
semantics, as defined in section 6.10.24 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
Specification>>.
The AV1 semantics associated with a reference picture is indicated by the
corresponding enumeration constant defined in the Video Std enumeration type
code:StdVideoAV1ReferenceName:

  * code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_INTRA_FRAME identifies the reference
    used for intra coding (code:INTRA_FRAME), as defined in sections 2 and
    7.11.2 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
  * All other enumeration constants refer to backward or forward references
    used for inter coding, as defined in sections 2 and 7.11.3 of the
    <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>:
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST2_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST2_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST3_FRAME identifies the
     code:LAST3_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_GOLDEN_FRAME identifies the
     code:GOLDEN_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_BWDREF_FRAME identifies the
     code:BWDREF_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_ALTREF2_FRAME identifies the
     code:ALTREF2_FRAME reference
  ** code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_ALTREF_FRAME identifies the
     code:ALTREF_FRAME reference

These enumeration constants are not directly used in any APIs but are used
to indirectly index into certain Video Std and Vulkan API parameter arrays.


[[encode-av1-prediction-modes]]
=== AV1 Prediction Modes

AV1 encoding supports multiple types of prediction modes, as described in
section 6.10.24 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeAV1PredictionModeKHR',desc='AV1 encode prediction mode',type='enums']
--
Possible AV1 encode prediction modes are as follows:

include::{generated}/api/enums/VkVideoEncodeAV1PredictionModeKHR.adoc[]

  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_PREDICTION_MODE_INTRA_ONLY_KHR specifies the
    use of _intra-only prediction mode_, used when encoding AV1 frames of
    type code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_KEY or
    code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_INTRA_ONLY.
  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_PREDICTION_MODE_SINGLE_REFERENCE_KHR specifies
    the use of _single reference prediction mode_, used when encoding AV1
    frames of type code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_INTER or
    code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_SWITCH with code:reference_select, as
    defined in section 6.8.23 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>,
    equal to 0.
    When using this prediction mode, the application must: specify a
    reference picture for at least one <<encode-av1-reference-names,AV1
    reference name>> in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:referenceNameSlotIndices
    that is supported by the implementation, as reported in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:singleReferenceNameMask.
  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_PREDICTION_MODE_UNIDIRECTIONAL_COMPOUND_KHR
    specifies the use of _unidirectional compound prediction mode_, used
    when encoding AV1 frames of type code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_INTER or
    code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_SWITCH with code:reference_select, as
    defined in section 6.8.23 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>,
    equal to 1, and both <<encode-av1-reference-names,reference names>> used
    for prediction are from the same reference frame group, as defined in
    section 6.10.24 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
    When using this prediction mode, the application must: specify a
    reference picture for at least two <<encode-av1-reference-names,AV1
    reference names>> in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:referenceNameSlotIndices
    that is supported by the implementation, as reported in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:unidirectionalCompoundReferenceNameMask,
    where those two reference names are one of the allowed pairs of
    reference names, as defined in section 5.11.25 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
    Specification>>, listed below:
  ** code:LAST_FRAME and code:LAST2_FRAME,
  ** code:LAST_FRAME and code:LAST3_FRAME,
  ** code:LAST_FRAME and code:GOLDEN_FRAME, or
  ** code:BWDREF_FRAME and code:ALTREF_FRAME.
  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_PREDICTION_MODE_BIDIRECTIONAL_COMPOUND_KHR
    specifies the use of _bidirectional compound prediction mode_, used when
    encoding AV1 frames of type code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_INTER or
    code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_SWITCH with code:reference_select, as
    defined in section 6.8.23 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>,
    equal to 1, and the two <<encode-av1-reference-names,reference names>>
    used for prediction are from different reference frame groups, as
    defined in section 6.10.24 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
    When using this prediction mode, the application must: specify a
    reference picture for at least one <<encode-av1-reference-names,AV1
    reference name>> from each reference frame group in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:referenceNameSlotIndices
    that is supported by the implementation, as reported in
    slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:bidirectionalCompoundReferenceNameMask.

The effective prediction mode used to encode individual AV1 mode info blocks
may: use simpler prediction modes than the one set by the application for
the frame, as allowed by the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>, in
particular:

  * Frames encoded with single reference prediction mode may: contain mode
    info blocks encoded with intra-only prediction mode.
  * Frames encoded with unidirectional compound prediction mode may: contain
    mode info blocks encoded with intra-only or single reference prediction
    mode.
  * Frames encoded with bidirectional compound prediction mode may: contain
    mode info blocks encoded with intra-only, single reference, or
    unidirectional compound prediction mode.

[[encode-av1-coding-blocks]]
=== AV1 Coding Blocks

AV1 encode supports two types of coding blocks, as defined in section 2 of
the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>:

  * _Superblock_.
  * _Mode info block_.


[[encode-av1-profile]]
=== AV1 Encode Profile

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR',desc='Structure specifying AV1 encode-specific video profile parameters',type='structs']
--
A video profile supporting AV1 video encode operations is specified by
setting slink:VkVideoProfileInfoKHR::pname:videoCodecOperation to
ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_ENCODE_AV1_BIT_KHR and adding a
sname:VkVideoEncodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR structure to the
slink:VkVideoProfileInfoKHR::pname:pNext chain.

The sname:VkVideoEncodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeAV1ProfileInfoKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:stdProfile is a code:StdVideoAV1Profile value specifying the AV1
    codec profile, as defined in section A.2 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1

=== AV1 Encode Capabilities

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR',desc='Structure describing AV1 encode capabilities',type='structs']
--
When calling flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR to query the
capabilities for an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode profile>>, the
slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR::pname:pNext chain must: include a
sname:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR structure that will be filled with the
profile-specific capabilities.

The sname:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR.adoc[]

    implementation will code pictures.
    This capability does not impose any valid usage constraints on the
    application.
    However, depending on the pname:codedExtent of the encode input picture
    resource, this capability may: result in a change of the resolution of
    the encoded picture, as described in more detail below.
  * pname:maxTiles indicates the maximum number of AV1 tile columns and rows
    the implementation supports.

index [eq]#i# is set, it indicates support for the
<<encode-av1-reference-names,AV1 reference name>>
[eq]#code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST_FRAME {plus} i#.

[NOTE]
====
These masks indicate which elements of the pname:referenceNameSlotIndices
member of slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR are supported to be used by
the implementation.
It is important to note that both the bits of these masks and the elements
of pname:referenceNameSlotIndices are indexed such that the first value
specifies the support bit and DPB slot index, respectively, for the AV1
reference name ename:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_LAST_FRAME (i.e. there is
no bit or element for code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_REFERENCE_NAME_INTRA_FRAME).
====

pname:codedPictureAlignment provides information about implementation
limitations to encode arbitrary resolutions.
In particular, some implementations may: not be able to generate bitstreams
aligned to the requirements of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>> (8x8).
In such cases, the implementation may: <<encode-av1-resolution-override,
override the width and height of the bitstream>>, in order to produce a
bitstream compliant to the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.
If such an override occurs, the encoded resolution of the coded picture is
enlargened, with the texel values used for the texel coordinates outside of
the bounds of the pname:codedExtent of the encode input picture resource
being first governed by the rules regarding the
<<encode-input-picture-granularity,encode input picture granularity>>.
Any texel values outside of the region described by the encode input picture
granularity are implementation-defined.
Implementations should: use well-defined values to minimize impact on the
produced encoded content.

[NOTE]
====
This capability does not impose additional application requirements.
However, these overrides change the effective resolution of the bitstream
and add padding pixels.
Applications sensitive to such overrides can: use this capability and the
corresponding <<encode-av1-resolution-override, override behavior>> to
compute the cropping needed to reproduce the original input of the encoding
and transmit it in a side channel (i.e. by using cropping fields available
in a container).
Additionally, applications can: explicitly consider this alignment in their
coded extent, to avoid implementation-defined texel values being included in
the encoded content.

=== AV1 Encode Parameter Sets

<<video-session-parameters,Video session parameters>> objects created with

contain a single instance of the following parameter set:

:operationType: encode
include::{chapters}/video/av1_parameter_sets.adoc[]

[[encode-av1-decoder-model-info]]
When code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader::pname:flags.timing_info_present_flag is
set, the AV1 sequence header can: be amended with AV1 decoder model
information, represented by a code:StdVideoEncodeAV1DecoderModelInfo
structure and interpreted as follows:

  * code:reserved1 is used only for padding purposes and is otherwise
    ignored;
  * all other members of code:StdVideoEncodeAV1DecoderModelInfo are
    interpreted as defined in section 6.4.4 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1
    Specification>>.

[[encode-av1-operating-points]]
When
code:StdVideoAV1SequenceHeader::pname:flags.reduced_still_picture_header is
not set, the AV1 sequence header can: be amended with AV1 operating point
information, represented by an array of
code:StdVideoEncodeAV1OperatingPointInfo structures and interpreted as
follows:

  * code:flags.reserved is used only for padding purposes and is otherwise
    ignored;
  * all other members of code:StdVideoEncodeAV1OperatingPointInfo are
    interpreted as the corresponding element of the respective arrays
    defined in section 6.4 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.

Implementations may: override any of these parameters according to the
semantics defined in the <<encode-overrides,Video Encode Parameter
Overrides>> section before storing the resulting AV1 sequence header into
the video session parameters object.
Applications need to use the flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR
command to determine whether any implementation overrides happened and to
retrieve the encoded AV1 sequence header in order to be able to produce a
compliant AV1 video bitstream.

The encoded AV1 sequence header retrieved using the
flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR command is encoded as a single
OBU with code:obu_type equal to code:OBU_SEQUENCE_HEADER, as defined in
section 5.3 of the <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>.

Such AV1 sequence header overrides may: also have cascading effects on the
implementation overrides applied to the encoded bitstream produced by video
encode operations.
If the implementation supports the
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_HAS_OVERRIDES_BIT_KHR
<<queries-video-encode-feedback,video encode feedback query>> flag, then the
application can: use such queries to retrieve feedback about whether any
implementation overrides have been applied to the encoded bitstream.

In general, implementations are expected to respect the

However, as implementations may have restrictions on the combination of tile
column and row counts, and tile widths and heights with respect to the
extent of the encoded frame beyond the restrictions specified in the
<<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>> and this specification (through video
profile capabilities), certain parameter combinations may require the
implementation to <<encode-overrides,override>> them in order to conform to
such implementation-specific limitations.

[[encode-av1-rate-control]]
=== AV1 Encode Rate Control

[[encode-av1-gop]]
==== Group of Pictures

In case of AV1 encoding it is common practice to follow a regular pattern of
frame types and prediction directions in display order when encoding
subsequent frames.
This pattern is referred to as the _group of pictures_ (GOP).

[[encode-av1-rate-control-group]]
The <<aomedia-av1,AV1 Specification>>, unlike some other video compression
standards, does not restrict the direction in display order of the
referenced frames based on the used frame type or
<<encode-av1-prediction-modes,AV1 prediction mode>>.
Accordingly, this specification introduces the concept of _rate control
groups_ for which the application can: specify separate rate control
configuration parameters.
When encoding a frame, the application specifies the rate control group the
encoded frame belongs to through a ename:VkVideoEncodeAV1RateControlGroupKHR
value in slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1PictureInfoKHR::pname:rateControlGroup.
This value is then used by the implementation's rate control algorithm to
determine which rate control configuration parameters apply to it.

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeAV1RateControlGroupKHR',desc='AV1 encode rate control group',type='enums']
--
Possible AV1 encode rate control groups are as follows:

include::{generated}/api/enums/VkVideoEncodeAV1RateControlGroupKHR.adoc[]

  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_INTRA_KHR should: be
    specified when encoding AV1 frames that use intra-only prediction (e.g.
    when encoding AV1 frames of type code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_KEY or
    code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_INTRA_ONLY).
  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_PREDICTIVE_KHR should: be
    specified when encoding AV1 frames that only have forward references in
    display order.
  * ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR should: be
    specified when encoding AV1 frames that have backward references in
    display order.

[NOTE]
====
While the application can specify any rate control group for any frame,
indifferent of the frame type, prediction mode, or prediction direction,
specifying a rate control group that does not reflect the prediction
direction used by the encoded frame may result in unexpected behavior of the
implementation's rate control algorithm.
====

--

[[encode-av1-regular-gop]]
A regular GOP is defined by the following parameters:

  * The number of frames in the GOP;
  * The number of consecutive frames encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR between
    frames encoded with other rate control groups in display order.

GOPs are further classified as _open_ and _closed_ GOPs.

Frame types in an open GOP follow each other in display order according to
the following algorithm:

  1. The first frame is always a frame encoded with
     ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_INTRA_KHR.
  2. This is followed by a number of consecutive frames encoded with
     ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR.
  3. If the number of frames in the GOP is not reached yet, then the next
     frame is a frame encoded with
     ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_PREDICTIVE_KHR and the
     algorithm continues from step 2.

[[encode-av1-open-gop]]
image::{images}/av1_open_gop.svg[align="center",title="AV1 open GOP",opts="{imageopts}"]

[[encode-av1-key-frame-period]]
In case of a closed GOP, a frame with the AV1 frame type
code:STD_VIDEO_AV1_FRAME_TYPE_KEY is used at a certain period.

[[encode-av1-closed-gop]]
image::{images}/av1_closed_gop.svg[align="center",title="AV1 closed GOP",opts="{imageopts}"]

It is also typical for AV1 encoding to use specific reference picture usage
patterns across the frames of the GOP.
The two most common reference patterns used are as follows:

[[encode-av1-ref-pattern-flat]]
Flat Reference Pattern::

  * Each frame encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_PREDICTIVE_KHR refers to
    the last frame that was not encoded using
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR, in
    display order, as its forward reference.
  * Each frame encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR refers to
    the last frame that was not encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR, in
    display order, as its forward reference, and refers to the next frame
    that was not encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR, in
    display order, as its backward reference.

image::{images}/av1_ref_pattern_flat.svg[align="center",title="AV1 flat reference pattern",opts="{imageopts}"]

[[encode-av1-ref-pattern-dyadic]]
Dyadic Reference Pattern::

  * Each frame encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_PREDICTIVE_KHR refers to
    the last frame that was not encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR, in
    display order, as its forward reference.
  * The following algorithm is applied to the sequence of consecutive frames
    encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_BIPREDICTIVE_KHR between
    frames using other <<encode-av1-rate-control-group,rate control groups>>
    in display order:

  . The frame in the middle of this sequence uses the frame preceding the
    sequence as its forward reference, and uses the frame following the
    sequence as its backward reference.
  . The algorithm is executed recursively for the following frame sequences:
  ** The frames of the original sequence preceding the frame in the middle,
     if any.
  ** The frames of the original sequence following the frame in the middle,
     if any.

image::{images}/av1_ref_pattern_dyadic.svg[align="center",title="AV1 dyadic reference pattern",opts="{imageopts}"]

The application can: provide guidance to the implementation's rate control
algorithm about the structure of the GOP used by the application.
Any such guidance about the GOP and its structure does not mandate that
specific GOP structure to be used by the application, as the frame type and
the selected <<encode-av1-rate-control-group,rate control group>> is still
application-controlled, however, any deviation from the provided guidance
may: result in undesired rate control behavior including, but not limited,
to the implementation not being able to conform to the expected average or
target bitrates, or other rate control parameters specified by the
application.

When an AV1 encode session is used to encode multiple temporal layers, it is
also common practice to follow a regular pattern for the AV1 temporal ID for
the encoded frames in display order when encoding subsequent frames.
This pattern is referred to as the _temporal GOP_.
The most common temporal layer pattern used is as follows:

[[encode-av1-layer-pattern-dyadic]]
Dyadic Temporal Layer Pattern::

  * The number of frames in the temporal GOP is [eq]#2^n-1^#, where [eq]#n#
    is the number of temporal layers.
  * The [eq]#i#^th^ frame in the temporal GOP uses temporal ID [eq]#t#, if
    and only if the index of the least significant bit set in [eq]#i# equals
    [eq]#n-t-1#, except for the first frame, which is the only frame in the
    temporal GOP using temporal ID zero.
  * The [eq]#i#^th^ frame in the temporal GOP uses the [eq]#r#^th^ frame as
    reference, where [eq]#r# is calculated from [eq]#i# by clearing the
    least significant bit set in it, except for the first frame in the
    temporal GOP, which uses the first frame of the previous temporal GOP,
    if any, as reference.

image::{images}/av1_layer_pattern_dyadic.svg[align="center",title="AV1 dyadic temporal layer pattern",opts="{imageopts}"]

[NOTE]
====
Multi-layer rate control and multi-layer coding are typically used for
streaming cases where low latency is expected, hence frames usually do not
use backward references in display order.

==== GOP Remaining Frames

Besides session level rate control configuration, the application can:
specify the number of frames per frame type remaining in the

The sname:VkVideoEncodeAV1GopRemainingFrameInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeAV1GopRemainingFrameInfoKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:useGopRemainingFrames indicates whether the implementation's rate
    control algorithm should: use the values specified in
    pname:gopRemainingIntra, pname:gopRemainingPredictive, and
    pname:gopRemainingBipredictive.
    If pname:useGopRemainingFrames is ename:VK_FALSE, then the values of
    pname:gopRemainingIntra, pname:gopRemainingPredictive, and
    pname:gopRemainingBipredictive are ignored.
  * pname:gopRemainingIntra specifies the number of frames encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_INTRA_KHR the
    implementation's rate control algorithm should: assume to be remaining
    in the <<encode-av1-gop,GOP>> prior to executing the next video encode
    operation.
  * pname:gopRemainingPredictive specifies the number of frames encoded with
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_AV1_RATE_CONTROL_GROUP_PREDICTIVE_KHR the
    implementation's rate control algorithm should: assume to be remaining

Setting pname:useGopRemainingFrames to ename:VK_TRUE and including this
structure in the pname:pNext chain of slink:VkVideoBeginCodingInfoKHR is
only mandatory if the
slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:requiresGopRemainingFrames
reported for the used <<video-profiles,video profile>> is ename:VK_TRUE.
However, implementations may: use these remaining frame counts, when
specified, even when it is not required.
In particular, when the application does not use a
<<encode-av1-regular-gop,regular GOP structure>>, these values may: provide
additional guidance for the implementation's rate control algorithm.

The slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1CapabilitiesKHR::pname:prefersGopRemainingFrames
capability is also used to indicate that the implementation's rate control
algorithm may: operate more accurately if the application specifies the
remaining frame counts using this structure.

As with other rate control guidance values, if the effective order and
number of frames encoded by the application are not in line with the
remaining frame counts specified in this structure at any given point, then
the behavior of the implementation's rate control algorithm may: deviate
from the one expected by the application.

[[encode-av1-qindex-delta-map]]
==== AV1 Quantizer Index Delta Maps

Quantization delta maps used with an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode
profile>> are referred to as _quantizer index delta maps_ and their texels
contain integer values representing quantizer index delta values that are
applied in the process of determining the
<<encode-av1-quantization,quantizer indices>> of the encoded picture.

Accordingly, AV1 quantizer index delta maps always have single channel
integer formats, as reported in
slink:VkVideoFormatPropertiesKHR::pname:format.

When the <<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control mode>> is
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DISABLED_BIT_KHR, the quantizer
index delta values are added to the constant quantizer index value that, in
effect, enable the application to explicitly control the used quantizer
index values at the granularity of the used
<<encode-quantization-map-texel-size,quantization map texel size>>.

For all other <<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control modes>>, the
quantizer index delta values can: be used to offset the quantizer index
values that the rate control algorithm would otherwise produce.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]

[[encode-av1-quantization]]
==== AV1 Encode Quantization

Performing AV1 encode operations involves the process of assigning quantizer
index values to individual AV1 mode info blocks.
This process depends on the used <<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control
mode>>, as well as other encode and rate control parameters, as described
below:

  * If the configured rate control mode is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DEFAULT_KHR, then the quantizer
    index value is initialized by the implementation-specific default rate
    control algorithm.
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  ** If the video encode operation is issued with a
     <<encode-quantization-delta-map,quantization delta map>>, the quantizer
     index delta value corresponding to the mode info block, as
     <<encode-quantization-map-fetched-texel,fetched from the quantization
     map>>, is added to the previously determined quantizer index value.
     If the fetched quantizer index delta value falls outside the supported
     quantizer index delta value range reported in the pname:minQIndexDelta
     and pname:maxQIndexDelta members of
     slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1QuantizationMapCapabilitiesKHR, then the
     quantizer index value used for the mode info block becomes undefined:.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  * If the configured rate control mode is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DISABLED_BIT_KHR, then the
    quantizer index value is initialized from the constant quantizer index
    value specified for the encoded frame.
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  ** If the video encode operation is issued with a
     <<encode-quantization-delta-map,quantization delta map>>, the quantizer
     index delta value corresponding to the mode info block, as
     <<encode-quantization-map-fetched-texel,fetched from the quantization
     map>>, is added to the previously determined quantizer index value.
     If the fetched quantizer index delta value falls outside the supported
     quantizer index delta value range reported in the pname:minQIndexDelta
     and pname:maxQIndexDelta members of
     slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1QuantizationMapCapabilitiesKHR, then the
     quantizer index value used for the mode info block becomes undefined:.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  * If the configured rate control mode is not
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DEFAULT_KHR or
    ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DISABLED_BIT_KHR, then the
    quantizer index value is initialized by the corresponding rate control
    algorithm.
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  ** If the video encode operation is issued with a
     <<encode-quantization-delta-map,quantization delta map>>, the quantizer
     index delta value corresponding to the mode info block, as
     <<encode-quantization-map-fetched-texel,fetched from the quantization
     map>>, is added to the previously determined quantizer index value.
     If the fetched quantizer index delta value falls outside the supported
     quantizer index delta value range reported in the pname:minQIndexDelta
     and pname:maxQIndexDelta members of
     slink:VkVideoEncodeAV1QuantizationMapCapabilitiesKHR, then the
     quantizer index value used for the mode info block becomes undefined:.
  ** If the video encode operation is issued with an
     <<encode-emphasis-map,emphasis map>>, the rate control will adjust the
     quantizer index value based on the emphasis value corresponding to the
     mode info block, as <<encode-quantization-map-fetched-texel,fetched
     from the quantization map>>, according to the following equation:
+
[eq]#QIndex~new~ = f(QIndex~prev~,e)#
+
Where [eq]#QIndex~new~# is the resulting quantizer index value,
[eq]#QIndex~prev~# is the previously determined quantizer index value,
[eq]#e# is the emphasis value corresponding to the macroblock, and [eq]#f#
is an implementation-defined function for which the following implication is
true:
+
[eq]#e~1~ < e~2~ => f(QIndex,e~1~) {geq} f(QIndex,e~2~)#
+
[NOTE]
====
This means that lower emphasis values will result in higher quantizer index
values, whereas higher emphasis values will result in lower quantizer index
values, but the function is not strictly decreasing with respect to the
input emphasis value for a given input quantizer index value.
====
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  ** If clamping to minimum quantizer index values is enabled in the applied
     rate control layer, then the quantizer index value is clamped to the
     corresponding minimum quantizer index value.
  ** If clamping to maximum quantizer index values is enabled in the applied
     rate control layer, then the quantizer index value is clamped to the
     corresponding maximum quantizer index value.
  * In all cases, the final quantizer index value is clamped to the minimum
    and maximum quantizer index values supported by the video profile.
