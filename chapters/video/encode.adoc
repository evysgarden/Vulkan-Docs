== Video Encode Operations

[[encode-input-picture]]
Video encode operations consume an _encode input picture_ and zero or more
reference pictures, and produce compressed video data to a video bitstream
buffer and an optional <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>>.

[NOTE]
====
Such encode input pictures can be used
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_decode_queue[]
as the <<decode-output-picture,output>> of video decode operations,
endif::VK_KHR_video_decode_queue[]
with graphics or compute operations,
ifdef::VK_KHR_surface[]
or with <<wsi,Window System Integration>> APIs,
endif::VK_KHR_surface[]
depending on the capabilities of the implementation.
====

Video encode operations may: access the following resources in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_VIDEO_ENCODE_BIT_KHR stage:

  * The image subregions corresponding to the source
    <<encode-input-picture-info,encode input picture>> and
    <<encode-active-reference-picture-info,active reference pictures>> with
    access ename:VK_ACCESS_2_VIDEO_ENCODE_READ_BIT_KHR.
  * The destination video bitstream buffer range and the optional
    <<encode-reconstructed-picture-info,reconstructed picture>> with access
    ename:VK_ACCESS_2_VIDEO_ENCODE_WRITE_BIT_KHR.

The image subresource of each <<video-picture-resources,video picture
resource>> accessed by the video encode operation is specified using a
corresponding slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure.
Each such image subresource must: be in the appropriate image layout as
follows:

  * If the image subresource is used in the video encode operation as an
    <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>, then it must: be in the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_KHR layout.
  * If the image subresource is used in the video encode operation as a
    <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> or <<reference-picture,
    reference picture>>, then it must: be in the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_DPB_KHR layout.
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
  * If the image subresource is used in the video encode operation as a
    <<encode-quantization-map,quantization map>>, then it must: be in the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_VIDEO_ENCODE_QUANTIZATION_MAP_KHR layout.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]

[[encode-unsuccessful]]
A video encode operation may: complete unsuccessfully.
In this case the target video bitstream buffer will have undefined:
contents.
Similarly, if <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>> is requested,
the <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed-picture>> will also have
undefined: contents, and the activated DPB slot will have an
<<dpb-slot-states,invalid picture reference>>.

If a video encode operation completes successfully and the codec-specific
parameters provided by the application adhere to the syntactic and semantic
requirements defined in the corresponding video compression standard, then
the target video bitstream buffer will contain compressed video data after
the execution of the video encode operation according to the respective
<<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>.


[[encode-codec-specific-semantics]]
=== Codec-Specific Semantics

The following aspects of video encode operations are codec-specific:

  * The compressed video data written to the target video bitstream buffer
    range.
  * The construction and interpretation of the list of
    <<encode-active-reference-picture-info,active reference pictures>> and
    the interpretation of the picture data referred to by the corresponding
    image subregions.
  * The construction and interpretation of information related to the
    <<encode-input-picture-info,encode input picture>> and the
    interpretation of the picture data referred to by the corresponding
    image subregion.
  * The decision on <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>>.
  * The construction and interpretation of information related to the
    optional <<encode-reconstructed-picture-info,reconstructed picture>> and
    the generation of picture data to the corresponding image subregion.
  * Certain aspects of <<encode-rate-control,rate control>>.

These codec-specific behaviors are defined for each video codec operation
separately.

ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
  * If the used video codec operation is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_ENCODE_H264_BIT_KHR, then the
    codec-specific aspects of the video encoding process are performed as
    defined in the <<encode-h264,H.264 Encode Operations>> section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
  * If the used video codec operation is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_ENCODE_H265_BIT_KHR, then the
    codec-specific aspects of the video encoding process are performed as
    defined in the <<encode-h265,H.265 Encode Operations>> section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]
  * If the used video codec operation is
    ename:VK_VIDEO_CODEC_OPERATION_ENCODE_AV1_BIT_KHR, then the
    codec-specific aspects of the video encoding process are performed as
    defined in the <<encode-av1,AV1 Encode Operations>> section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]


[[encode-overrides]]
==== Video Encode Parameter Overrides

Implementations supporting video encode operations for any particular video
codec operation often support only a subset of the available encoding tools
defined by the corresponding video compression standards.
Accordingly, certain implementation-dependent limitations may: apply to
codec-specific parameters provided through the structures defined in the
Video Std headers corresponding to the used video codec operation.

Exposing all of these restrictions on particular codec-specific parameter
values or combinations thereof in the form of application-queryable
capabilities is impractical, hence this specification allows implementations
to _override_ the value of any of the codec-specific parameters, unless
otherwise specified, as long as all of the following conditions are met:

  * If the application-provided codec-specific parameters adhere to the
    syntactic and semantic requirements and rules defined by the used video
    compression standard, and thus would be usable to produce a video
    bitstream compliant with that standard, then the codec-specific
    parameters resulting from the process of implementation overrides must:
    also adhere to the same requirements and rules, and any video bitstream
    produced using the overridden parameters must: also be compliant.
  * The overridden codec-specific parameter values must: not have an impact
    on the codec-independent behaviors defined for video encode operations.
  * The implementation must: not override any codec-specific parameters
    specified to a command that may: cause application-provided
    codec-specific parameters specified to subsequent commands to no longer
    adhere to the semantic requirements and rules defined by the used video
    compression standard, unless the implementation also overrides those
    parameters to adhere to any such requirements and rules.
  * The overridden codec-specific parameter values must: not have an impact
    on the codec-specific picture data access semantics.
  * The overridden codec-specific parameter values may: change the contents
    of the codec-specific bitstream elements produced by video encode
    operations or otherwise retrieved by the application (e.g. using the
    flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR command) but must: still
    adhere to the codec-specific semantics defined for that video codec
    operation, including, but not limited to, the number, type, and order of
    the encoded codec-specific bitstream elements.

Besides codec-specific parameter overrides performed for
implementation-dependent reasons, applications can: enable the
implementation to apply additional <<encode-optimizing-overrides,optimizing
overrides>> that may: improve the efficiency or performance of video
encoding operations.
However, implementations must: meet the conditions listed above even in case
of such optimizing overrides.

[NOTE]
====
Unless the application opts in for optimizing overrides, implementations are
not expected to override any of the codec-specific parameters, except when
such overrides are necessary for the correct operation of video encoder
implementation due to limitations to the available encoding tools on that
implementation.
====


[[encode-operation-steps]]
=== Video Encode Operation Steps

Each video encode operation performs the following steps in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_VIDEO_ENCODE_BIT_KHR stage:

  1. Reads the input picture data from the <<encode-input-picture,encode
     input picture>>;
  2. Determine derived encoding quality parameters according to the
     <<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>> and the
     current <<encode-rate-control,rate control>> state;
  3. Compresses the input picture data according to the
     <<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>, applying
     any prediction data read from the <<active-reference-pictures,active
     reference pictures>> and rate control restrictions in the process;
  4. Writes the encoded bitstream data to the destination video bitstream
     buffer range;
  5. Performs picture reconstruction of the encoded video data according to
     the <<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>,
     applying any prediction data read from the <<active-reference-pictures,
     active reference pictures>> in the process, if a
     <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>> is specified and
     <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>> is requested;
  6. If <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference picture setup>> is requested, the
     <<dpb-slot,DPB slot index>> specified in the
     <<encode-reconstructed-picture-info,reconstructed picture information>>
     is <<dpb-slot-states,activated>> with the
     <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed picture>>;
  7. Writes the reconstructed picture data to the <<reconstructed-picture,
     reconstructed picture>>, if one is specified, according to the
     <<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>.

When <<encode-reconstructed-picture-info,reconstructed picture information>>
is provided, the specified <<dpb-slot,DPB slot>> index is associated with
the corresponding <<bound-reference-picture-resources,bound reference
picture resource>>, indifferent of whether <<encode-ref-pic-setup,reference
picture setup>> is requested.


=== Capabilities

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR',desc='Structure describing general video encode capabilities for a video profile',type='structs']
--
When calling flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceVideoCapabilitiesKHR with
pname:pVideoProfile->videoCodecOperation specifying an encode operation, the
slink:VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR structure must: be included in the
pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkVideoCapabilitiesKHR structure to retrieve
capabilities specific to video encoding.

The sname:VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/VkVideoEncodeCapabilitiesKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:sType is a elink:VkStructureType value identifying this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
    structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:VkVideoEncodeCapabilityFlagBitsKHR
    describing supported encoding features.
  * pname:rateControlModes is a bitmask of
    elink:VkVideoEncodeRateControlModeFlagBitsKHR indicating supported
    <<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control modes>>.
  * pname:maxRateControlLayers indicates the maximum number of
    <<encode-rate-control-layers,rate control layers>> supported.
  * pname:maxBitrate indicates the maximum supported bitrate.
  * pname:maxQualityLevels indicates the number of discrete
    <<encode-quality-level,video encode quality levels>> supported.
    Implementations must: support at least one quality level.
  * pname:encodeInputPictureGranularity indicates the granularity at which
    <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>> data is encoded and may:
    indicate a texel granularity up to the size of the largest supported
    codec-specific coding block.
    This capability does not impose any valid usage constraints on the
    application, however, depending on the contents of the encode input
    picture, it may: have effects on the encoded bitstream, as described in
    more detail below.
  * pname:supportedEncodeFeedbackFlags is a bitmask of
    elink:VkVideoEncodeFeedbackFlagBitsKHR values specifying the supported
    flags for <<queries-video-encode-feedback,video encode feedback
    queries>>.

Implementations must: include support for at least
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_OFFSET_BIT_KHR and
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_FEEDBACK_BITSTREAM_BYTES_WRITTEN_BIT_KHR in
pname:supportedEncodeFeedbackFlags.

[[encode-input-picture-granularity]]
pname:encodeInputPictureGranularity provides information about the way
<<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>> data is used as input to video
encode operations.
In particular, some implementations may: not be able to limit the set of
texels used to encode the output video bitstream to the image subregion
specified in the slink:VkVideoPictureResourceInfoKHR structure corresponding
to the encode input picture (i.e. to the resolution of the image data to
encode specified in its pname:codedExtent member).

[NOTE]
====
For example, the application requests the coded extent to be 1920x1080, but
the implementation is only able to source the encode input picture data at
the granularity of the codec-specific coding block size which is 16x16
pixels (or as otherwise indicated in pname:encodeInputPictureGranularity).
In this example, the content is horizontally aligned with the coding block
size, but not vertically aligned with it.
Thus encoding of the last row of coding blocks will be impacted by the
contents of the input image at texel rows 1080 to 1087 (the latter being the
next row which is vertically aligned with the coding block size, assuming a
zero-based texel row index).
====

If pname:codedExtent rounded up to the next integer multiple of
pname:encodeInputPictureGranularity is greater than the extent of the image
subresource specified for the <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>,
then the texel values corresponding to texel coordinates outside of the
bounds of the image subresource may: be undefined:.
However, implementations should: use well-defined default values for such
texels in order to maximize the encoding efficiency for the last coding
block row/column, and/or to ensure consistent encoding results across
repeated encoding of the same input content.
Nonetheless, the values used for such texels must: not have an effect on
whether the video encode operation produces a compliant bitstream, and must:
not have any other effects on the encoded picture data beyond what may:
otherwise result from using these texel values as input to any compression
algorithm, as defined in the used video compression standard.

[NOTE]
====
While not required, it is generally a good practice for applications to make
sure that the image subresource used for the encode input picture has an
extent that is an integer multiple of the codec-specific coding block size
(or at least pname:encodeInputPictureGranularity) and that this padding area
is filled with known values in order to improve encoding efficiency,
portability, and reproducibility.

    video encode operation by reporting the
    ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_RANGE_KHR
    <<query-result-status-codes,query result status code>>.

[NOTE]
====
Some implementations may: not be able to reliably detect insufficient
bitstream buffer range conditions in all situations.
Such implementations will not report support for the

encode capability flag for the video profile, but may: still report the
ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_RANGE_KHR query
result status code in certain cases.
Applications should: always check for the specific query result status code
ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BITSTREAM_BUFFER_RANGE_KHR even
when this encode capability flag is not supported by the implementation for
the video profile in question.

[[encode-quality-level]]
=== Video Encode Quality Levels

Implementations can: support more than one video encode quality levels for a
video encode profile, which control the number and type of
implementation-specific encoding tools and algorithms utilized in the
encoding process.

[NOTE]
====
Generally, using higher video encode quality levels may: produce higher
quality video streams at the cost of additional processing time.
However, as the final quality of an encoded picture depends on the contents
of the <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>, the contents of the
<<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>>, the codec-specific
encode parameters, and the particular implementation-specific tools used
corresponding to the individual video encode quality levels, there are no
guarantees that using a higher video encode quality level will always
produce a higher quality encoded picture for any given set of inputs.

=== Retrieving Encoded Session Parameters

Any codec-specific parameters stored in video session parameters objects
may: need to be separately encoded and included in the final video bitstream
data, depending on the used video compression standard.
In such cases the application must: call the
flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR command to retrieve the encoded
parameter data from the used video session parameters object in order to be
able to produce a compliant video bitstream.

[NOTE]
====
This is needed because implementations may: have changed some of the
codec-specific parameters stored in the video session parameters object, as
defined in the <<encode-overrides,Video Encode Parameter Overrides>>
section.
In addition, the flink:vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR command enables
the application to retrieve the encoded parameter data without having to
encode these codec-specific parameters manually.
====

[open,refpage='vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR',desc='Get encoded parameter sets from a video session parameters object',type='protos']
--
Encoded parameter data can: be retrieved from a video session parameters
object created with a video encode operation using the command:

include::{generated}/api/protos/vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR.adoc[]

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the video session
    parameters object.
  * pname:pVideoSessionParametersInfo is a pointer to a
    slink:VkVideoEncodeSessionParametersGetInfoKHR structure specifying the
    parameters of the encoded parameter data to retrieve.
  * pname:pFeedbackInfo is either `NULL` or a pointer to a
    slink:VkVideoEncodeSessionParametersFeedbackInfoKHR structure in which
    feedback about the requested parameter data is returned.
  * pname:pDataSize is a pointer to a code:size_t value related to the
    amount of encode parameter data returned, as described below.
  * pname:pData is either `NULL` or a pointer to a buffer to write the
    encoded parameter data to.

If pname:pData is `NULL`, then the size of the encoded parameter data, in
bytes, that can: be retrieved is returned in pname:pDataSize.
Otherwise, pname:pDataSize must: point to a variable set by the application
to the size of the buffer, in bytes, pointed to by pname:pData, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of bytes actually written
to pname:pData.
If pname:pDataSize is less than the size of the encoded parameter data that
can: be retrieved, then no data will be written to pname:pData, zero will be
written to pname:pDataSize, and ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead
of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that no encoded parameter data was
returned.

If pname:pFeedbackInfo is not `NULL` then the members of the
slink:VkVideoEncodeSessionParametersFeedbackInfoKHR structure and any
additional structures included in its pname:pNext chain that are applicable
to the video session parameters object specified in
pname:pVideoSessionParametersInfo->videoSessionParameters will be filled
with feedback about the requested parameter data on all successful calls to
this command.

[NOTE]
====
This includes the cases when pname:pData is `NULL` or when
ename:VK_INCOMPLETE is returned by the command, and enables the application
to determine whether the implementation <<encode-overrides,overrode>> any of
the requested video session parameters without actually needing to retrieve
the encoded parameter data itself.
====

[NOTE]
====
This query does not behave consistently with the behavior described in
<<fundamentals-binaryresults, Opaque Binary Data Results>>, for historical
reasons.

If the amount of data available is larger than the passed pname:pDataSize,
the query returns a ename:VK_INCOMPLETE success status instead of a
ename:VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR error status, and writes zero to
pname:pDataSize.

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to record the
    command.
  * pname:pEncodeInfo is a pointer to a slink:VkVideoEncodeInfoKHR structure

[[encode-active-reference-picture-info]]
Active Reference Picture Information::

The list of <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>> used by
a video encode operation is a list of image subregions used as the source of
<<reference-picture,reference picture>> data and related parameters, and is
derived from the slink:VkVideoReferenceSlotInfoKHR structures provided as
the elements of the pname:pEncodeInfo->pReferenceSlots array.
For each element of pname:pEncodeInfo->pReferenceSlots, one or more elements
are added to the active reference picture list, as defined by the
<<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>.
Each element of this list contains the following information:

  * The image subregion within the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the
    <<video-picture-resources,video picture resource>> used as the reference
    picture.
  * The <<dpb-slot,DPB slot>> index the reference picture is associated
    with.
  * The codec-specific reference information related to the reference
    picture.

[[encode-reconstructed-picture-info]]
Reconstructed Picture Information::

Information related to the optional <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed
picture>> used by a video encode operation is derived from the
slink:VkVideoReferenceSlotInfoKHR structure pointed to by
pname:pEncodeInfo->pSetupReferenceSlot, if not `NULL`, as defined by the
<<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>, and consists
of the following:

  * The image subregion within the image subresource
    <<video-image-subresource-reference,referred>> to by the
    <<video-picture-resources,video picture resource>> used as the
    reconstructed picture.
  * The <<dpb-slot,DPB slot>> index to use for picture reconstruction.
  * The codec-specific reference information related to the reconstructed
    picture.

[[encode-ref-pic-setup]]
Specifying a valid slink:VkVideoReferenceSlotInfoKHR structure in
pname:pEncodeInfo->pSetupReferenceSlot is always required, unless the video
session was created with
slink:VkVideoSessionCreateInfoKHR::pname:maxDpbSlots equal to zero.
However, the DPB slot identified by
pname:pEncodeInfo->pSetupReferenceSlot->slotIndex is only
<<dpb-slot-states,activated>> with the <<reconstructed-picture,reconstructed
picture>> specified in
pname:pEncodeInfo->pSetupReferenceSlot->pPictureResource if reference
picture setup is requested according to the
<<encode-codec-specific-semantics,codec-specific semantics>>.

If reconstructed picture information is specified, but reference picture
setup is not requested, according to the codec-specific semantics, the
contents of the <<video-picture-resources,video picture resource>>
corresponding to the reconstructed picture will be undefined: after the
video encode operation.

[NOTE]
====
Some implementations may always output the reconstructed picture or use it
as temporary storage during the video encode operation even when the
reconstructed picture is not marked for future reference.

[[encode-rate-control]]
== Video Encode Rate Control

The size of the encoded bitstream data produced by video encode operations
is a function of the following set of constraints:

  * The capabilities of the compression algorithms defined and employed by
    the used video compression standard;
  * Restrictions imposed by the selected <<video-profiles,video profile>>
    according to the rules defined by the used video compression standard;
  * Further restrictions imposed by the <<video-coding-capabilities,
    capabilities>> supported by the implementation for the selected
    <<video-profiles,video profile>>;
  * The image data in the <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>> and
    the set of <<active-reference-pictures,active reference pictures>> (as
    these affect the effectiveness of the compression algorithms employed by
    the video encode operations);
  * The set of codec-specific and codec-independent encoding parameters
    provided by the application.

These also inherently define the set of decoder capabilities required for
reconstructing and processing the picture data in the encoded bitstream.

[[encode-bitrate]]
Video coding uses _bitrate_ as the quantitative metric associated with
encoded bitstream data size which expresses the rate at which video
bitstream data can: be transferred or processed, measured in number of bits
per second.
This bitrate is both a function of the encoded bitstream data size of the
encoded pictures as well as the _frame rate_ used by the video sequence.

Rate control algorithms are used by video encode operations to enable
adjusting encoding parameters to achieve a target bitrate, or otherwise
directly or indirectly control the bitrate of the generated video bitstream
data.
These algorithms are usually not defined by the used video compression
standard, although some video compression standards do provide non-normative
guidelines for implementations.

Accordingly, this specification does not mandate implementations to produce
identical encoded bitstream data outputs in response to video encode
operations, however, it does define a set of codec-independent and
codec-specific parameters that enable the application to control the
behavior of the rate control algorithms supported by the implementation.
Some of these parameters guarantee certain implementation behavior while
others provide guidance for implementations to apply various rate control
heuristics.

[NOTE]
====
Applications need to make sure that they configure rate control parameters
appropriately and that they follow the promises made to the implementation
through parameters providing guidance for the implementation's rate control
algorithms and heuristics in order to be able to get the desired rate
control behavior and to be able to hit the set bitrate targets.
In addition, the behavior of rate control may also differ across
implementations even if the capabilities of the used video profile match
between those implementations.
This may happen due to implementations applying different rate control
algorithms or heuristics internally, and thus even the same set of guidance
parameter values may have different effects on the rate control behavior
across implementations.
====


[[encode-rate-control-modes]]
=== Rate Control Modes

After a video session is reset to the <<video-session-uninitialized,initial
state>>, the default behavior and parameters of video encode rate control
are entirely implementation-dependent and the application cannot: affect the
bitrate or quality parameters of the encoded bitstream data produced by
video encode operations unless the application changes the rate control
configuration of the video session, as described in the
<<video-coding-control,Video Coding Control>> section.

For each supported <<video-profiles,video profile>>, the implementation may:
expose a set of _rate control modes_ that are available for use by the
application when encoding bitstreams targeting that video profile.
These modes allow using different rate control algorithms that fall into one
of the following two categories:

  1. Per-operation rate control
  2. Stream-level rate control

In case of _per-operation rate control_, the bitrate of the generated video
bitstream data is indirectly controlled by quality, size, or other encoding
parameters specified by the application for each individual video encode
operation.

In case of _stream-level rate control_, the application can: directly
specify target bitrates besides other encoding parameters to control the
behavior of the rate control algorithm used by the implementation across
multiple video encode operations.

[open,refpage='VkVideoEncodeRateControlModeFlagBitsKHR',desc='Video encode rate control modes',type='enums']

The rate control modes are defined with the following enums:

include::{generated}/api/enums/VkVideoEncodeRateControlModeFlagBitsKHR.adoc[]

[[encode-leaky-bucket-model]]
=== Leaky Bucket Model

Video encoding implementations use the _leaky bucket model_ for stream-level
rate control.
The leaky bucket is a concept referring to the interface between the video
encoder and the consumer (for example, a network connection), where the
video encoder produces encoded bitstream data corresponding to the encoded
pictures and adds them in the leaky bucket while its content are drained by
the consumer.

Analogously, a similar leaky bucket is considered to exist at the input
interface of a video decoder, into which encoded bitstream data is
continuously added and is subsequently consumed by the video decoder.
It is desirable to avoid overflowing or underflowing this leaky bucked
because:

  * In case of an underflow, the video decoder will be unable to consume
    encoded bitstream data in order to decode pictures (and optionally
    display them).
  * In case of an overflow, the leaky bucket will be unable to accommodate
    more encoded bitstream data and such data may: need to be thrown away,
    leading to the loss of the corresponding encoded pictures.

These requirements can: be satisfied by imposing various constraints on the
encoder-side leaky bucket to avoid its overflow or underflow, depending on
the used rate control algorithm and codec parameters.
However, enumerating these constraints is outside the scope of this
specification.

The term _virtual buffer_ is often used as an alternative to refer to the
leaky bucket.

This virtual buffer model is defined by the following parameters:

  * The bitrate (`R`) at which the encoded bitstream is expected to be
    processed.
  * The size (`B`) of the virtual buffer.
  * The initial occupancy (`F`) of the virtual buffer.

In this model the virtual buffer is used to smooth out fluctuations in the
bitrate of the encoded bitstream over time without experiencing buffer
overflow or underflow, as long as the bitrate of the encoded stream does not
diverge from the target bitrate for extended periods of time.

This buffering may: inherently impose a processing delay, as the goal of the
model is to enable decoders maintain a consistent processing rate of an
encoded bitstream with varying data rate.

The initial or start-up delay (`D`) is computed as:

  {empty}:: [eq]#`D` = `F` / `R`#

[NOTE]
====
Applications need to configure the virtual buffer with sufficient size to
avoid or minimize buffer overflows and underflows while also keeping it
small enough to meet their latency goals.
====


[[encode-rate-control-layers]]
=== Rate Control Layers

Some video compression standards and <<video-profiles,video profiles>> allow
associating encoded pictures with specific _video coding layers_.
The name, identification, and semantics associated with such video coding
layers are defined by the corresponding video compression standards.

Analogously, stream-level rate control can: be configured to use one or more
_rate control layers_:

  * When a single rate control layer is configured, it is applied to all
    encoded pictures, regardless of the picture's video coding layer.
    In this case the distribution of the available bitrate budget across
    video coding layers is implementation-dependent.
  * When multiple rate control layers are configured, each rate control
    layer is applied to the corresponding video coding layer, i.e. only
    across encoded pictures pertaining to the corresponding video coding
    layer.

Individual rate control layers are identified using _layer indices_ between
zero and `N-1`, where `N` is the number of active rate control layers.

Rate control layers are only applicable when using
<<encode-rate-control-modes,stream-level rate control modes>>.

ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_quantization_map[]
[[encode-quantization-map]]
== Video Encode Quantization Maps

Quantization maps are slink:VkImage objects that are used in video encode
operations to control the relative quantization parameter values across the
encoded picture.
Each texel in the quantization map controls the relative quantization
parameter values used to encode the corresponding rectangular block of
texels in the <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>.

[[encode-quantization-map-texel-size]]
The size of the rectangular block of texels each quantization map texel
covers is referred to as the _quantization map texel size_.

The extent of the image subresource used as a quantization map when encoding
a picture with a coded extent of [eq]#(pname:width,pname:height)# thus has
to be at least [eq]#({lceil}pname:width / pname:texelSize.width{rceil},
{lceil}pname:height / pname:texelSize.height{rceil})#, where pname:texelSize
is the used quantization map texel size.

In particular, the quantization map texel at location
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)# contains relative quantization parameter values used
when encoding the pname:texelSize sized rectangular block of the
<<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>> starting at the texel location
[eq]#(pname:x {times} pname:texelSize.width, pname:y {times}
pname:texelSize.height)#.

[[encode-quantization-map-fetched-texel]]
The quantization map texel size does not always match the size of the
codec-specific coding blocks used during encoding.
Furthermore, some video compression standards allow the size of the
codec-specific coding blocks to vary across the encoded picture.
In order to accommodate for such mismatches between the granularity at which
quantization parameters are stored in quantization maps and the granularity
at which they are applied to codec-specific coding blocks during encoding,
the following mapping rules are applied to define the quantization map texel
value corresponding to a given codec-specific coding block with a size
[eq]#(pname:width,pname:height)# at the texel location
[eq]#(pname:x,pname:y)# in the <<encode-input-picture,encode input
picture>>:

  * If the size of the codec-specific coding block matches the used
    quantization map texel size, then the fetched quantization map value
    corresponding to the codec-specific coding block is the texel value at
    the texel location [eq]#(pname:x / pname:texelSize.width, pname:y /
    pname:texelSize.height)#.
  * If the size of the codec-specific coding block is smaller than the used
    quantization map texel size, then the fetched quantization map value
    corresponding to the codec-specific coding block is the texel value at
    the texel location [eq]#({lfloor}pname:x /
    pname:texelSize.width{rfloor}, {lfloor}pname:y /
    pname:texelSize.height{rfloor})#.
  * If the size of the codec-specific coding block is larger than the used
    quantization map texel size, then the fetched quantization map value
    corresponding to the codec-specific coding block may: be any value
    determined as the linear interpolation of the quantization map texel
    values in the subregion starting at texel location [eq]#(pname:x /
    pname:texelSize.width,pname:y / pname:texelSize.height)# with a size
    [eq]#({lceil}pname:width / pname:texelSize.width{rceil},
    {lceil}pname:height / pname:texelSize.height{rceil})#.

The actual control parameters stored in the quantization map depend on its
type.
This specification supports the following types of quantization maps:

  * <<encode-quantization-delta-map,Quantization delta maps>>
  * <<encode-emphasis-map,Emphasis maps>>


[[encode-quantization-delta-map]]
=== Quantization Delta Maps

Quantization delta maps contain values that directly affect the
codec-specific quantization parameter values used to encode the
corresponding block of the <<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>.

Quantization delta maps can: be used in conjunction with any
<<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control mode>>, including
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DISABLED_BIT_KHR.

Due to their codec-specific nature, they are described in more detail in the
corresponding codec-specific section for video encode operations that
support them.
In particular:

ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
  * The behavior of quantization delta maps used with an
    <<encode-h264-profile,H.264 encode profile>> is described in the
    <<encode-h264-quantization>> and <<encode-h264-qp-delta-map>> sections.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
  * The behavior of quantization delta maps used with an
    <<encode-h265-profile,H.265 encode profile>> is described in the
    <<encode-h265-quantization>> and <<encode-h265-qp-delta-map>> sections.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]
  * The behavior of quantization delta maps used with an
    <<encode-av1-profile,AV1 encode profile>> is described in the
    <<encode-av1-quantization>> and <<encode-av1-qindex-delta-map>>
    sections.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]

This specification does not support quantization delta maps for any other
video encode operation.


[[encode-emphasis-map]]
=== Emphasis Maps

Emphasis maps contain values that indirectly affect the codec-specific
quantization parameter values used to encode the corresponding block of the
<<encode-input-picture,encode input picture>>.

The texels of emphasis maps contain values that provide input to the encoder
implementation about the relative importance (emphasis) of regions of the
encoded pictures in order to enable the implementation's rate control
algorithm to allocate more bitrate budget for regions of the encoded picture
with higher emphasis values than to those with lower emphasis values.

Emphasis maps can: only be used when the current
<<encode-rate-control-modes,rate control mode>> configured for the video
session is not ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DEFAULT_KHR or
ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_RATE_CONTROL_MODE_DISABLED_BIT_KHR.

As these emphasis values only control the otherwise implementation-specific
behavior of the used rate control algorithm, this specification does not
impose additional restrictions on implementations beyond the ones outlined
in the corresponding codec-specific sections describing quantization
behavior:

ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
  * The behavior of emphasis maps used with an <<encode-h264-profile,H.264
    encode profile>> is described in the <<encode-h264-quantization>>
    section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h264[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
  * The behavior of emphasis maps used with an <<encode-h265-profile,H.265
    encode profile>> is described in the <<encode-h265-quantization>>
    section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_h265[]
ifdef::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]
  * The behavior of emphasis maps used with an <<encode-av1-profile,AV1
    encode profile>> is described in the <<encode-av1-quantization>>
    section.
endif::VK_KHR_video_encode_av1[]

This specification does not support emphasis maps for any other video encode
operation.

Emphasis maps always have single channel unsigned normalized integer formats
and implementations are required: to support the ename:VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM
format for emphasis maps, as reported in
slink:VkVideoFormatPropertiesKHR::pname:format, when the video encode
profile supports ename:VK_VIDEO_ENCODE_CAPABILITY_EMPHASIS_MAP_BIT_KHR.
