=== Description

This extension enables C-like structure layout for SPIR-V blocks.
It modifies the alignment rules for uniform buffers, storage buffers and
push constants, allowing non-scalar types to be aligned solely based on the
size of their components, without additional requirements.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.2

Vulkan APIs in this extension are included in core Vulkan 1.2, with the EXT
suffix omitted.
However, if Vulkan 1.2 is supported and this extension is not, the
code:scalarBlockLayout capability is optional.
External interactions defined by this extension, such as SPIR-V token names,
retain their original names.
The original Vulkan API names are still available as aliases of the core
functionality.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.4

If Vulkan 1.4 is supported, support for the code:scalarBlockLayout
capability is required.
