=== Description

The `VK_KHR_8bit_storage` extension allows use of 8-bit types in uniform and
storage buffers, and push constant blocks.
This extension introduces several new optional features which map to SPIR-V
capabilities and allow access to 8-bit data in code:Block-decorated objects
in the code:Uniform and the code:StorageBuffer storage classes, and objects
in the code:PushConstant storage class.

The code:StorageBuffer8BitAccess capability must: be supported by all
implementations of this extension.
The other capabilities are optional.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.2

Vulkan APIs in this extension are included in core Vulkan 1.2, with the KHR
suffix omitted.
However, if Vulkan 1.2 is supported and this extension is not, the
code:StorageBuffer8BitAccess capability is optional.
External interactions defined by this extension, such as SPIR-V token names,
retain their original names.
The original Vulkan API names are still available as aliases of the core
functionality.

=== Promotion to Vulkan 1.4

If Vulkan 1.4 is supported, support for the code:storageBuffer8BitAccess
capability is required.
